# A Lox Tree-walk Interpreter in Go

This is a Go implementation of the Lox language, specifically its [tree-walk interpreter](https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-tree-walk-interpreter.html).
The book implements this section with Java, but we'll use Go here. Using Go allows us to learn different aspects of it when it comes to writing a language.
And it's fun. So why not?
